# Malware-Detection
We have developed and trained various Machine learning classifier models on the features of pe files as of now the models are giving good accuracy. But, this methodology has a few constraints, for example, it can't recognize obscure and new age malware. Nonetheless, the discovery of malware still remains tricky as malware developers are adopting new techniques to evade the malware detection techniques. 
Since we trained machine learning models for the identification of malware and even developed a python script which can analyse the files as malware and benign, we extended a step further and developed a Malware Scanner website as our contribution to the world. A free and open source platform for the purpose of identifying the malicious softwares before letting them harm your computers and endangering your security.
